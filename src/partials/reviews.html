          Last time I have visited a cooking course by Eva I was impressed with the way she
          explained everything to people. You can be sure you will manage to cook a delicious dish
          even if it is your first time in the kitchen! <br />
          Thank you so much for the masterclass! Looking forward to the next one and highly
          recommend it to everyone!

          I ordered the Happy Birthday donuts which were very cute.The product was packaged very
          securely with a cold pack at the base. The product arrived as scheduled. The quality of
          the three layer giant donut cake with an inner layer of butter cream frosting and an outer
          layer of pink cookie frosting formed a protective shell around the cake sealing in the
          freshness. It was delicious. It was the sweet treat to kick off my holiday indulgence. So
          sweet it made my teeth hurt. Very satisfying! Everything about this birthday donut order
          went well, delivery, taste and condition upon receipt. Would order again.
